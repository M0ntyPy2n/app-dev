## May Favorite Movie
Taxi Driver
```
{
  "Director": "Martin Scorsese",
  "Movie": "Taxi Driver",
  "Release Date": 1972
}
```
The movie is about a taxi driver named Travis Bickle, starred by Robert De Niro, who is an ex-military coping with PTSD from the vietnam war. This is my favorite movie because it is about a man traversing the city life that is filled with filth, decadence, and violence. The movies' climax involves Travis finally snapping due to a series of unfortunate events.
